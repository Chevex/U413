U413
====

This is the code for the once "famous" U413.com community. I started [the original community](https://github.com/chevex/StartOfTheInternet) in 2010 and the project was written in C#. The project was later taken over by some friends who wrote [their own version](https://github.com/ConsciousCode/u413) in python. This version was written in 2013 and maintained until March 2014 when I (Chevex) retired from contributing to the project. Even though I'm no longer contributing to the project I still intend to maintain it; I will review pull requests and fix small bugs if they are reported, but other than that this project will be entirely dependent upon community interest and involvement.

If you're reading this and you would like to resurrect this project then you are welcome to do so. Just start working on it and submit some pull requests. After you've had a few pull requests merged in I will likely just add you as a contributor to the project so you can actively contribute whenever you wish. This is not a guarantee, but the chances are good if I don't have any issues with your work :)

### Getting Started

I put together a brief video showing you how to get started with the project.
