h3 -= What is U413? =-
p U413 is a web application with a command line interface. It is meant to serve as a community for a niche crowd of geeks that enjoy interacting with a terminal. Most people don't realize it up front, but once you learn the terminal and its commands it is often much faster to use than a traditional web app. U413 aims to be a fun and friendly place for geeks to come together and have good conversations.

h3 -= History of U413 =-
p The first iteration of U413 began in January of 2009. It was an idea I had while I was in the shower. Version 1.0 was developed in ASP.NET web forms because that was the extent of my web development capabilities at the time. At first I only intended to share the project with a few friends, but it didn't take long for the interwebz to take notice. First bungie.net forum users came flooding in, then LUELinks, followed by 4chan and many others. It was my first experience with something viral and I was fairly naive about a lot of the web at the time. For instance, I didn't even know how to do a WHOIS lookup on a domain. I discovered really quickly what it's like when the internet finds out your true identity. I learned that you either have to be really good at hiding your personal information, or else just don't try to hide it at all and just embrace the fact that people know who you are.

p I continued iterating on the application over time, adding things like real-time chat and links. Eventually my tiny hosting account couldn't take the load anymore and I knew it was time for a re-write. At this point in my life I had a lot of distractions popping up with school, work, and meeting my wife. It wouldn't be until sometime in 2010 that I finally released a proper version 2.0, but by that point I had neglected it too long and very few people were still around. I felt bad for letting the community die so I gave it away to loyal users of the site known as Lamberti, JamezQ, and PiMaster.

p In January of 2011 I decided to completely redesign U413 from the ground up. I wrote a brand new application using ASP.NET MVC 3. U413 had long since moved on from me. They had completely rewritten it in python and had a loyal following. I decided to re-brand U413 3.0 as StartOfTheInter.net (SOTI) and release it. I had a lot of fun re-writing the application once more because I took the time to implement proper code organization. At the time I was really proud of SOTI and was excited to start building a new community. It was clear however, that the excitement about such an application had waned. I never really saw much success with SOTI. Part of it was my fault because of unfinished features and promised releases that never happened. As great an application as SOTI was I still felt like it was a hassle to modify. I had quite a few different people email me asking how they could build their own command line style web application. I wanted to create a generic framework that would allow anyone with average development skills to put together their own terminal application and use whatever UI they wanted to. It was this desire to create something generic and easy to use that prompted me to develop my first true Node.js module called "shotgun".

h3 -= Tech Behind the New U413 =-
p The new U413 is completely brand new. It is written using Node.js, which is just a program that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine to run JavaScript on the server. Node.js is a lot of fun to develop in. JS on the client, JS on the server, and with MongoDB it's even JS in the database. The backbone and heart of the new U413 is a module that I wrote and published called <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/shotgun">shotgun</a>. If you're interested in creating your own terminal applications, on the web or otherwise, then shotgun is the module for you. Shotgun eliminates all the hard work. From parsing the user input to executing commands and updating the UI. The only things you have to write are a series of tiny custom command modules. Shotgun takes care of the rest.

p Most node modules that claim to be command line tools or helpers are directly related to the actual command line. Meaning the module only works with the actual console. Existing modules are usually only helpers you can use when writing an app that will act as one single command that can be run from a real terminal. Shotgun overcomes these limitations because it is its own command line framework. It's also UI-agnostic; meaning it does not make assumptions about the UI. It parses user input, determines what command the user intends to run, breaks up the other arguments and creates an options object that it then passes to the command module matching the user's input. Assuming the application has defined a custom command module that matches the user's input then it will be invoked and handed the options object containing all the arguments and their values provided by the user.

p It's okay if none of that made any sense to you. All you really need to know is that for the first time ever anyone can create a command line style web application with ease. It's completely intuitive and designed to stay out of your way. If you like what you see here on U413 and want to build your own then you'll be pleased to know that shotgun is just waiting for you to "npm install shotgun" ;)
